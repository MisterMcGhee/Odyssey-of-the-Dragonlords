## Overview

The Five Gods are widely celebrated as the settlers' favored deities in Thylea. They appeared during the First War, helping the Dragonlords and mortal races defeat the Titans Sydon and Lutheria. Unlike traditional gods, most of them walk among the people in mortal guise, taking mortal spouses and even ruling cities.

Shrines to the Five can be found in nearly every settler household, though prayers must be accompanied by the sign against the evil eye to ward off the jealous gaze of the Titans.

> [!important] Divine Secret The Five Gods are not what they appear to be. Their true nature is one of the campaign's major twists. As GM, remember that when the Oath of Peace ends, the Five Gods will revert to their true forms: dragons who had been imbued with divine power and locked into mortal forms.

## Worship and Powers

The Five Gods wield divine powers that were once part of the Titans' dominion. Their power has grown as mortal worship increased over the centuries, while the influence of Sydon and Lutheria waned.

Clerics and paladins may serve any of the Five Gods, with domains corresponding to each deity's sphere of influence. Prayers and offerings to the Five are often made in secret or accompanied by protective gestures, as the Titans remain jealous of any worship not directed toward them.

## The Oath of Peace

The Five Gods are bound by the Oath of Peace, which prevents them from directly confronting Sydon, Lutheria, or their servants. While they can advise heroes and even travel with them, they cannot assist in battles against the Titans or their minions until the Oath expires.

This limitation is crucial to the campaign, as it places the burden of saving Thylea squarely on the shoulders of the heroes.

## Campaign Integration

Throughout the campaign, the Five Gods serve as important allies and quest-givers:

- **Kyrah** accompanies the heroes from the beginning, recording their deeds
- **Pythor** requests the heroes' help to rescue his daughter and later joins their crew
- **Volkan** assists with forging magical items at the Mithral Forge
- **Vallus** provides counsel and magical artifacts
- **Mytros** remains a distant but powerful force that clerics and paladins can call upon
