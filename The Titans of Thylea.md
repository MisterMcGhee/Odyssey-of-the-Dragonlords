# The Titans of Thylea

## Overview

The Titans are the ancient divine powers native to Thylea who have existed since the dawn of time. They ruled unchallenged until the arrival of the Dragonlords and the emergence of the Five Gods. Though their influence has waned in the past 500 years, they remain incredibly powerful forces that shape the world through storms, dreams, and the turning of seasons.

The Titans are feared and revered across all of Thylea. Even in cities where the Five Gods are openly worshipped, daily sacrifices are still made to appease the Titans, particularly Sydon and Lutheria, who demand constant acknowledgment of their power.

> [!important] Divine Secret The Titans have been planning their revenge for 500 years. When the Oath of Peace expires, they intend to destroy the mortal kingdoms completely. Sydon has been gathering a massive fleet in the Forgotten Sea, while Lutheria has been corrupting the dreams of key figures in preparation for war.

## The Titans' Powers and Influence

Before the arrival of the Dragonlords, the Titans wielded unchallenged power over Thylea. Sydon could conjure apocalyptic storms with his right hand and cataclysmic earthquakes with his left. Lutheria held dominion over the land of dreams, and her voice could give life to the dead.

Though their direct influence has been somewhat contained by the Oath of Peace, they still exert tremendous power:

- **Worship and Sacrifice**: Every temple in Thylea fears the wrath of Sydon. Daily sacrifices are offered to him in every village, even in places where the Five are predominantly worshipped.
    
- **Servants and Agents**: The Titans command vast armies of native creatures, including centaurs, cyclopes, gygans, and fey. They also have mortal followers, such as the Order of Sydon.
    
- **Environmental Control**: Sydon controls the weather and ocean currents, while Lutheria influences dreams and can create nightmares that cause madness.
    
- **Divine Curses**: The Titans can inflict terrible curses upon those who displease them, transforming them into harpies, medusae, or other monstrosities.
    

## The Oath of Peace

The Oath of Peace, sworn 500 years ago, prevents the Titans from taking direct vengeance upon the mortals of Thylea. In exchange, daily sacrifices to the Titans are maintained, and their temples are honored.

This oath is about to expire at the start of the campaign, which will allow the Titans to wage war on mortals once again. The prophecy foretells that this will bring about the Doom of Thylea unless the heroes can prevent it.

## Campaign Integration

Throughout the campaign, the Titans serve as the primary antagonists:

### Sydon's Actions Against the Party

- **The Centaur Warband**: After the heroes complete their first Labor, Gaius of the Order of Sydon summons centaurs to attack them.
    
- **The Lord of Storms**: Sydon sends a destructive hurricane to destroy the Ultros after the heroes have explored a few islands.
    
- **Sydon's Fleet**: After the heroes have confronted Lutheria, they may glimpse Sydon's invasion fleet heading toward Mytros.
    
- **Confrontation at Praxys**: The heroes can challenge Sydon at his tower, though he will likely escape to make his final stand at Mytros.
    

### Lutheria's Actions Against the Party

- **Dreaming of Lutheria**: After leaving the Temple of the Oracle, the heroes experience a nightmare that causes short-term madness.
    
- **Madness of Lutheria**: After completing their second Labor, the heroes experience another nightmare causing long-term madness.
    
- **Corruption of Lutheria**: While sailing the Cerulean Gulf, Lutheria sends a dream that fills the heroes with bloodlust, potentially causing them to fight each other.
    
- **Confrontation at Hypnos**: The heroes can challenge Lutheria at her throne in the Nether Sea, though she has ways of returning from death.
