## Overview

Thylea, often called "the Lost Land," is a forgotten continent located across a vast expanse of ocean, far beyond the borders of all known maps. It is a land of ancient splendor, untouched by modern civilization, where fey creatures and native races have lived since time immemorial. The land takes its name from the Mother Goddess Thylea, who watches over her creation in the form of a colossal world-tree at the heart of the archipelago.

## Geography

The continent consists of a large central landmass that tapers into peninsulas, surrounded by hundreds of islands. The known regions include:

- **The Heartlands** - The central regions where most mortal settlements are located
- **The Cerulean Gulf** - A vast body of water dotted with numerous islands
- **The Forgotten Sea** - Clear ocean expanse that stretches for a thousand miles in every direction
- **The Nether Sea** - A strange underworld sea where Lutheria dwells
- **The Oldwood** - Ancient forests inhabited by druids and fey creatures
- **The Steppes** - Rolling plains where centaur tribes roam

Thylea's landscape is dotted with sprawling ruins, glittering lagoons, and massive statues. Great beasts wander the plains, and fey creatures haunt the woods.
